# HICP Italy Time Series Analysis and Forecasting

## Overview
Analysis and forecasting of the **Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP)** for Italy using **R** and **time series models**.  
Focus on **seasonality adjustment, exponential smoothing models, and forecast evaluation**.  

**Skills & Keywords:** Time Series Analysis, Forecasting, ETS Models, Seasonality Adjustment, R Programming, Data Visualization, HICP, Italy.

The project was carried out by a **group of 3 students**.

## Files
- **data.xls**: Excel file with HICP data for several Eurozone countries.  
- **TimeSeries.R**: R script implementing all the analysis steps: visualization, seasonal adjustment, ETS modeling, predictions, and accuracy evaluation.

## Problem
Monthly evolution of HICP in Italy, from 1996 onwards. Tasks include:  

1. **Visualize the HICP series** and describe trends.  
2. **Seasonally adjust the series** to remove monthly effects.  
3. **Build exponential smoothing models (ETS)** to predict HICP from Jan 2011 to May 2012. Compare additive, multiplicative, and automatic ETS models.  
4. **Evaluate forecast accuracy** using standard measures.
